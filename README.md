# Blockchain Transaction System (MERN)

**Description**  
A full-stack **blockchain project** that simulates secure money transactions and block creation. Built with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js + Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL for storing transactions and blocks.

This system allows users to:
✔️ Create and validate transactions  
✔️ Generate new blocks and append them to the blockchain  
✔️ View transaction history and block data  
✔️ Interact with a responsive frontend interface

I contributed by:  
- Implementing the **block creation logic**, including hashing and chain linking  
- Managing **money transactions** between wallets  
- Building RESTful APIs in **Express.js** for blockchain data  
- Connecting backend with **React frontend** for real-time blockchain visualization  
- Ensuring secure and stable communication between UI and server  

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
