# Blockchain Transaction System (MERN)

**Description**  
A complete **MERN‑stack blockchain project** that simulates secure money transactions and block creation. Built with React for the frontend, Node.js + Express for the backend, and MongoDB for decentralized-like storage of transactions and blocks.

This system allows users to:
✔️ Create and validate transactions  
✔️ Generate new blocks and append them to the blockchain  
✔️ View transaction history and block data  
✔️ Interact with a user‑friendly frontend interface  

## 🧑‍💻 My Role — Contributor

I contributed to this project by:  
- Implementing the **block creation logic**, including hashing and linking blocks  
- Integrating **money transaction handling** between wallets/accounts  
- Building RESTful APIs in **Express.js** for transactions and blockchain data  
- Connecting backend logic with **React frontend** to display real‑time blockchain data  
- Ensuring secure and stable interactions between UI and server

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Blockchain Concepts:** Block hashing, chain linking, transaction validation  

## 📦 Features

- Add new transactions
- Create new blocks
- Maintain an immutable chain of blocks
- Dynamic UI for transaction and block visualization
